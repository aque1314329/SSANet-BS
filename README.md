## Abstract

Band selection (BS) aims to reduce redundancy in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). Existing
BS approaches typically model HSI only in a single dimension, either spectral or spatial, without
exploring the interactions between different dimensions. To this end, we propose an unsupervised
BS method based on a spectralâ€“spatial cross-dimensional attention network, named SSANet-BS. This
network is comprised of three stages: a band attention module (BAM) that employs an attention
mechanism to adaptively identify and select highly significant bands; two parallel spectralâ€“spatial
attention modules (SSAMs), which fuse complex spectralâ€“spatial structural information across dimensions in HSI; a multi-scale reconstruction network that learns spectralâ€“spatial nonlinear dependencies
in the SSAM-fusion image at various scales and guides the BAM weights to automatically converge
to the target bands via backpropagation. The three-stage structure of SSANet-BS enables the BAM
weights to fully represent the saliency of the bands, thereby valuable bands are obtained automatically.
Experimental results on four real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SSANet-BS.

## How to run

1. Install dependency: `tqdm`, `torch` and `scipy`.
2. Set your dataset, nbs (number of bands to select) and hyper parameter in `main.py`.
3. Run `python main.py`, the selected bands will display in terminal.
